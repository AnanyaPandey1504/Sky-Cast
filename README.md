## SKY-CAST-  A Drone RTSP Video Stream Viewer App (Android)

This is an Android application developed as part of a technical task to demonstrate RTSP video streaming capabilities using the **LibVLC** library.
The app is designed to connect to a live RTSP stream (such as from a drone camera), display it within the app, and allow recording of the stream locally.
It also supports viewing the video in **Picture-in-Picture (PiP)** mode.

## ‚úÖ Features Implemented

### 1. **RTSP Stream Playback**
- Users can enter an RTSP URL at the top of the screen.
- The stream is played using the **LibVLC** library.
- Displays the live video from the drone (or any RTSP server).

### 2. **Record Stream**
- A `Record` button is provided to start/stop recording the stream.
- Recordings are saved locally in the app‚Äôs private directory.
- The app ensures that recording only starts when the stream is playing.

### 3. **Picture-in-Picture (PiP) Mode**
- A `PiP` button launches the video in a floating window, allowing multitasking.
- Works on Android 8.0 (API 26) and above.
- Stream continues playing while in PiP mode.
